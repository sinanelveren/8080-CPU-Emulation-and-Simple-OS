Use Debug mode "0"  "1"  "(2 old hw)"



P1  :
	0..50 bytes has been write to file sytem from memory succesfuly. (mem location 0x0600) (file block '0')
	but, there are a problem on fileSystem.dat file, I don't have time for fix it.

	You can open it with "cat fileSystem.dat" command.  I will write bytes succesfuly.

P2 :
	Working correctly but, while i read from file system when there are only one file.. I chose fildeHandler as "0" (default) 
	so it independent from fileName -- (i tried file name "newFile"). (Note: i couldn't file handler from E register. Its always read 0, but I know I used it correctly.)


I didnt do rest of hw before dead line, sorry.
